In 2010 Colin GÃ¼nter finished his master thesis on Haiku's WLAN stack. His work was supported by Haiku users with donations to Haikuware's bounty program. After his move to New Zealand he didn't find the time to prep the documents for publication. But now it's finally done and available at a <a href="https://github.com/coguhn/Masterarbeit">GitHub repo [Dead link as of December 2017]</a>.

Two documents (both mirrored at the Haiku website) should be interesting to developers curious about Haiku's WLAN stack: The thesis <a href="/files/Masterarbeit.pdf">Masterarbeit.pdf</a> (1.35 MiB) and a graphical description of Haiku's network initalization <a href="/files/Network-init.pdf">Network-init.pdf</a> (177 KiB).

Only slight problem: it's all in German. Still, it might be useful to non-German speakers by looking through the diagrams and code and using some online translation tool...
The repo contains also all the LyX files, which could be translated if anyone is interested, and compiled to a PDF.

Thanks, Colin for making your thesis available to all (under MIT license with the copyright transferred to Haiku Inc. no less) and, of course, for the work on the WLAN stack itself. Would be nice to see you back as active contributor. :)

<em>Addendum</em>
I almost forgot. In the course of working on his thesis Colin created another document of interest to Haiku historians: <a href="https://github.com/coguhn/Masterarbeit/tree/master/Name-history">Name-history.pdf [Dead link as of December 2017]</a> (233 KiB) documents the name changing process from OpenBeOS to Haiku.
