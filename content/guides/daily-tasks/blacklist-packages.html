<p>With the advent of package management and <a href="https://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/commit/?id=3a7e0b00147f7a33bc52cb75a56bde8d9652d92a">hrev46391</a>, it has become possible to prevent a packaged file from being extracted at boot time.</p>

<p>In Haiku's <a href="/docs/userguide/en/bootloader.html">boot menu</a>, there is a 'Blacklist entries' option available. However, this method will only let you disable system packages, and only until the next time you reboot.</p>

<p>As you may know, package management has made some Haiku directories read-only, so unlike in the past, it is no longer possible to just delete or rename a problematic driver or library. The blacklisting functionality addresses this issue without requiring any editing of package file content.</p>

<p>So let's go through the few steps needed:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Figure out which file in which package you want to blacklist, and whether the file is contained in a system package or in a user one.</li>
 <li>Next step is to create a text file named 'packages' in /boot/system/settings, or in /boot/home/config/settings/global. The first directory is used for blacklisting system packages, the second for user packages.</li>
 <li>And finally, in the 'packages' file, we put something like:
<pre>Package 'packagename' {
	EntryBlacklist {
		'entrypath'
		...
	}
}
</pre>
For example, to blacklist the intel_extreme driver and the xhci driver, which are both part of the 'haiku' system package, the 'packages' file looks like this:
<pre>Package haiku  {
	EntryBlacklist {
		add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin/intel_extreme
		add-ons/kernel/busses/usb/xhci
	}
}
</pre>
 <ul>
  <li>'packagename' is the name of the package without version, for example 'haiku'.</li>
  <li>'entrypath' is the relative path to the installation location, e.g. "add-ons/Translators/FooTranslator".</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p>Any blacklisted entries will be ignored by packagefs and will no longer appear in the file system.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let's look at a practical example, blacklisting the broadcom570x driver. We create a 'packages' text file in /boot/system/settings with the following content:

<pre>Package haiku {
	EntryBlacklist {
		add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin/broadcom570x
	}
}</pre>
</p>

<p>We then save the file and reboot. Once Haiku starts again, the package is re-mounted and the file is ignored by packagefs.<p>
